# Synergy Vintage 🍷

For vintage computer enthusiasts, Synergy Vintage aims to keep the origins of 
Synergy alive. You can use Synergy Vintage on operatings systems
available from 2001 to 2005; Windows (95, 98, ME, or 2000), Mac OS X 
(Jaguar to Tiger), and Linux (e.g. Red Hat 7).

## History

Work started on Synergy in 2001 by Chris Schoenenman, inspired by an earlier 
version called CosmoSynergy. Synergy's predecessor was an internal
tool at Cosmo Software (an SGI subsidiary) created out of frustration with 
KVM switches.

> The first incarnation of Synergy was CosmoSynergy, created by Richard Lee 
and Adam Feder then at Cosmo Software, Inc., a subsidiary of 
> SGI (nee Silicon Graphics, Inc.), at the end of 1996. They wrote it, and 
> Chris Schoeneman contributed, to solve a problem: most of the engineers in 
> Cosmo Software had both an Irix and a Windows box on their desks and 
> switchboxes were expensive and annoying. CosmoSynergy > was a great success 
> but Cosmo Software declined to productize it and the company was later 
> closed.
> Synergy is a from-scratch reimplementation of CosmoSynergy. It provides most
> of the features of the original and adds a few improvements.

Though, versions as early as 
[v0.9.8](https://web.archive.org/web/20021102070634/http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=59275)
were published in November 2002, those binaries and source archives are sadly 
long gone. The earliest version we have on record is v1.0.14 from the 24th of 
August, 2003.

## Last Vintage

The transition from Synergy Vintage to Synergy Classic is when the Qt GUI was 
introduced. The last recorded version of the Qt GUI is 
[1.3.5](https://github.com/symless/synergy-core/releases/tag/1.3.5). 
Tast recorded version of Synergy without Qt is 1.3.1, and this is what 
Synergy Vintage is based on.
